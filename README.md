# Spotify Mutify

This application mutes Spotify when it is playing an ad. Currently this only supports **Windows**.

This will read the memory of the Spotify application to find out the currently playing track, and mute the application accordinly.

## Note

Spotify has recently updated their guidelines:

```
Weâ€™ve updated our User Guidelines, making it clear that all types of ad blockers, bots,
and fraudulent streaming activities are not permitted;
```

**Use this at your own risk.**

## Usage

```
spotify-mutify.exe --username <spotify_username>
```

### TODOs (Maybe?)

-   MacOS Support?
-   Launch Spotify if not already open.
-   Mute Spotify directly instead of using the Mute key.

# Spotify Mutify

Currently this only supports **Windows**.

Mute those overly loud Spotify Ads.

This will read the memory of the Spotify application to find out the currently playing track, and mute the application accordinly.

## Note

Spotify has recently updated their guidelines:

```
Weâ€™ve updated our User Guidelines, making it clear that all types of ad blockers, bots,
and fraudulent streaming activities are not permitted;
```

**Use this at your own risk.**
